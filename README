# LL Animurecs

LL Animurecs is a Ruby on Rails / MySQL web application designed to make searching for anime recommendations easy and painless. The idea is to have a Danbooru-esque searchable tagging system with commenting and up/downvoting for anime series; this system can easily be extended to work for manga or any other media.

To get started, you should be able to generate a new rails project and copy the source for LL Animurecs into the project directory, make your own config/databases.yml file as pertains to your setup, and then use db/schema.rb to create the relevant tables for the application.
